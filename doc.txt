In multiplication:
     Take 3 list L1 , L2 , L3 all NULL
     1  ->find first digit multiplication and store in L2
        ->make a corressponding zero List contains zero's(for 1st digit NULL)
        ->append zeros in L2, get them from zero list
        ->ADD L1(NULL) and L2 , store in L3
        ->delete L1 and make it NULL , copy data of L3
        ->delete L3 and make NULL
        ->delete L2 , make NULL
        =>repeate from first , till temp2 != NULL
Keep in mind : make a copy funtion dont simply do L1 = L2 , it will point to same address , once we free L2 seg faul for L1 uses.
Once delete List , make pointers NULL.
